I’m a MS student at IIT Mandi, studying Cybersecurity and Cognitive Science.
My research focus is decision making. Specifically, I work on developing interactive simulations of networks 
involving deception techniques which provide a way to study hacker’s decision strategies during a 
cyber-attack. My research has two aims:
    1. Study adversarial behaviour of attackers using simulations and games involving deception.
    2. Develop computational cognitive models to prevent cyber-attacks happening in real time.

My advisor is Prof. Varun Dutt (ACS Lab, IIT Mandi). I also work with Dr Palvi Aggarwal (DDM Lab, CMU) on 
developing HackIT tool - a simulation providing 

Before IIT Mandi, I received a B.E. in Computer Science from Birla Institute of Technology Mesra.

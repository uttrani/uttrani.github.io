<p>I’m a MS student at IIT Mandi, studying Cybersecurity and Cognitive Science.<p>
<p>My research focus is decision making. Specifically, I work on developing interactive simulations of networks 
involving deception techniques which provide a way to study hacker’s decision strategies during a 
cyber-attack. My research has two aims:
<ol>
    <li>Study adversarial behaviour of attackers using simulations and games involving deception.</li>
    <li>Develop computational cognitive models to prevent cyber-attacks happening in real time.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>My advisor is Prof. Varun Dutt (ACS Lab, IIT Mandi). I also work with Dr Palvi Aggarwal (DDM Lab, CMU) on 
developing HackIT tool - a simulation providing CLI based environment.</p>

<p>Before IIT Mandi, I received a B.E. in Computer Science from Birla Institute of Technology Mesra.</p>
<p>My publications can be found here.</p>
